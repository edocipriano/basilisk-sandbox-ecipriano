# Fixed Flux Droplet Evaporation - MAC Solver

This a version of the test case [fixedflux.c](fixedflux.c)
using the [mac.h](../src/navier-stokes/mac-evaporation.h)
solver. That solver is quite limited: no surface tension,
no adapt, no 3D. However, it is useful in this case to
show that the velocity field with the evaporation is much
smoother using this formulation.

Evaporation of a liquid droplet with a fixed vaporization
flowrate. In these conditions, the droplet consumption
is obtained from a mass balance on the liquid droplet and
the analytic solution can be easily derived:
$$
  \dfrac{dR}{dt} = \dfrac{\dot{m}}{\rho_l}
$$

We want to test and compare the droplet consumption with
the exact solution, considering the presence of the Stefan
flow. The simulation setup used here was adapted from
[Malan et al, 2021](#malan2021geometric).
The animation shows the consuption of the liquid droplet,
that maintains a perfectly spherical shape throughtout the
entire lifetime, as well as the radial velocity field
caused by the phase change.

/**
## Phase Change Setup

We divide the mass balance by the density of the gas phase,
according with the non-dimensional treatment reported in
the [paper](#malan2021geometric). There is no need to shift
the volume expansion term because we do not transport the
temperature or mass fractions in this test case.

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the mac Navier-Stokes equations solver with
the evaporation source term in the projection step. The
velocity potential approach is adopted to
obtain a divergence-free velocity which can be used for
the VOF advection equation. The evporation model is
combined with the fixed flux mechanism, that imposes
a constant vaporization flowrate.

The droplet is consumed by the evaporation is a smooth way,
and the comparison between the numerical and the analytic
