/**
## Optically-Thin Model

This is the simplest model to implement, it computes the
heat loss for radiation according to the following equation:
$$
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{q}_{rad} =
-4\sigma\sum\limits_{i=1}^{NGS}a_{p,i} P x_i (T^4 - T_b^4)
$$
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $a_{p,i}$
is the Planck mean absorption coefficient of species $i$,
$P x_i$ is the partial pressure of the chemical species,
$T$ is the local flame temperature, while $T_b$ is a baseline
temperature (approximated as 300K).

The following properties are required by the radiation
model:

* *T*: temperature of the system [K]
* *P*: pressure of the system [Pa]
* *xCO2*: mole fraction of CO2 [moli/molt]
* *xH2O*: mole fraction of H2O [moli/molt]

Only CO2 and H2O are considered, since their contribution to
the radiation is the gratest, if compared with the other
species.
