The Markers-And-Cells (MAC) formulation was first described in the

1965](/src/references.bib#harlow1965). It relies on a *face*
discretisation of the velocity components `u.x` and `u.y`, relative to
the (centered) pressure `p`. This guarantees the consistency of the
discrete gradient, divergence and Laplacian operators and leads to a
stable (mode-free) integration. */
