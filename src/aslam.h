# Aslam Extrapolations

This module implements the PDE-based Aslam extrapolation
methods ([Aslam 2003](#aslam2004partial)). Using these
functions, a discontinuous field can be extended from the
liquid phase to the gas-phase and vice-versa using
constant and extrapolations.

These methods are expensive, since the PDE must be solved
at steady-state. However, most of the times they are
used just for a few steps in order to extend the field for
a few cells across the interface, without covering the whole
domain.

/**
## Constant Extrapolation

The constant extrapolation of a field *f*, existing only in
a portion of space defined by *ls*, can be extrapolated in
the whole domain solving the following PDE:

$$
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t}
+ H(\phi)\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla f = 0
$$

where $H(\phi)$ is the Heaviside function, used to define the
region where the field should be extrapolated and where it
should not be modified:

$$
H(\phi) =
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } \phi > 0,\\
  0 & \text{if } \phi \leq 0.
\end{cases}
$$

while $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the unit normal.

## Linear Extrapolation

The linear extrapolation of the field *f* along the normal
direction, can be achieved from the solution of the
following PDE:

$$
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t}
+ H(\phi)\left(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla f - f_n \right) = 0
$$

Which is similar to the equation resolved with the constant
extrapolation procedure, except for the source term $f_n$,
which is the directional derivative of $f$ in the normal
direction, defined as:

$$
f_n = \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla f
$$

Since this function is defined only in the region where $f$
is defined, we apply the constant extrapolation in order to
obtain a field $f_n$ defined on the whole domain:

$$
\dfrac{\partial f_n}{\partial t}
+ H(\phi)\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla f_n = 0
$$

Therefore, the linear interpolation requires the solution of
two different extrapolation PDEs, and the same logic applies
if higher order extrapolations have to be solved.
