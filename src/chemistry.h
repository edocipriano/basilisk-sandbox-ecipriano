# Chemical Reactions

The chemical reactions are solved using the OpenSMOKE++ libraries
and an ODE system of equations. Despite the general formulation
of the chemistry, so far it is solved just in the gas phase,
focusing on the combustion kinetics. Different types of reactions
may require the implementation of new reactor systems 
([reactors.h](reactors.h)).
