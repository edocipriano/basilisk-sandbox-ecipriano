# Contact angles

This file is used to impose contact angles on boundaries for
interfaces described using a [VOF](vof.h) tracer and [height
functions](heights.h).

We first overload the default function used to compute the normal,
defined in [fractions.h](). */

the Mixed-Youngs-Centered approximation. */

/**
The height functions are stored in the vector field associated with
each VOF tracer. They need to be updated every time the VOF field
changes. For the [centered Navier-Stokes
solver](navier-stokes/centered.h), this means after initialisation and
after VOF advection. 

Note that strictly speaking this should be done for each
[sweep](vof.h#sweep_x) of the direction-split VOF advection, which we
do not do here i.e. we use the normal at the beginning of the timestep
and assume it is constant during each sweep. This seems to work
fine. */

The macro below can be used to impose a contact angle on a boundary by

height function will be required to compute curvature at shallow
angles. */

## Three-dimensional implementation

While the 2D implementation is trivial, in 3D one must take into
account the projection onto the boundary of the normal to the
interface (see [Afkhami \& Bussmann, 2009](#afkhami2009) for
details). This leads to the code below, where the only complication
comes from taking into account the relative orientations of the
boundary and height-function components. 

From a user point-of-view, using the *contact_angle()* macro is as
simple as in 2D. */
