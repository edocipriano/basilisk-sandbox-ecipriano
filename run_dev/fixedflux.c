# Fixed Flux Droplet Evaporation

Evaporation of a liquid droplet with a fixed vaporization
flowrate. In these conditions, the droplet consumption
is obtained from a mass balance on the liquid droplet and
the analytic solution can be easily derived:
$$
  \dfrac{dR}{dt} = \dfrac{\dot{m}}{\rho_l}
$$

We want to test and compare the droplet consumption with
the exact solution, considering the presence of the Stefan
flow. The simulation setup used here was adapted from
[Malan et al, 2021](#malan2021geometric).
The animation shows the consuption of the liquid droplet,
that maintains a perfectly spherical shape throughtout the
entire lifetime, as well as the radial velocity field
caused by the phase change.

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the centered Navier-Stokes equations solver with volumetric sources in
the projection step. We add the phase change module with the fixed flux policy,
which calculates the interfacial vaporization rate as a fixed value provided by
the user.

The droplet is consumed by the evaporation is a smooth way, and the comparison
