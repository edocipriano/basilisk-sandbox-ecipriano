# Expansion of a Nucleated Bubble

A spherical bubble is initialized on the lower-left corner of and AXI domanin.
Similarly to the Scriven problem, the bubble is expanded due to the temperature
gradient between the interface of the bubble, which remains at saturation
temperature, and the superheated liquid environment. However, in this case we
consider the left side of the boundary as a solid wall and we impose a contact
angle, which influences the bubble growth process.

This is the simplest nucleate boiling configuration, where no microlayer
modelling and no heat exchange with the solid wall is condered.

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the centered Navier--Stokes equations solver with volumetric source in
the projection step. The phase change is directly included using the boiling
module, which sets the best (default) configuration for boiling problems. Many
features of the phase change (boiling) model can be modified directly in this
file without changing the source code, using the phase change model object
`pcm`. Compiling with `-DJUMP=1` changes the Navier--Stokes solver to the
velocity-jump formulation, which employs a GFM approach to set the interface
velocity jump. A fixed contact angle is imposed on the left side of the domain.
