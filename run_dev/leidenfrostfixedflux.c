# Leidenfrost Droplet - Fixed Flux

The [Leidenfrost effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect)
is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, close to a solid
surface, evaporates producing an insulating vapor layer which
keeps the liquid droplet away from the solid surface.

## Choice of the Navier-Stokes Equations Solver

The numerical simulation of this phenomena is not straight-forward,
the main complication is that the model to obtain the liquid (extended)
velocity for the transport of the volume fraction must consider the
influence of the Stefan flow. Initially, the droplet moves toward the
solid surface. The evaporation process creates a velocity field which
points radially outward from the droplet and, when the drop is sufficiently
close to the solid surface, the Stefan flow pushes the droplet away
from the wall.

To achieve this coupling between the transport of the liquid phase and the Stefan flow
we can't use the [navier-stokes/centered-doubled.h](/sandbox/ecipriano/src/navier-stokes/centered-doubled.h),
because this model decouples the advection velocity from the field velocity
which includes the Stefan flow. Although this approach is beneficial when
dealing with static droplets with strong density ratio, it is not adequate
for Leidenfrost effect simulations. We use the [navier-stokes/velocity-jump.h](/sandbox/ecipriano/src/navier-stokes/velocity-jump.h)
approach instead, which limits oscillations in the velocity field, and it couples
the effect of the Stefan flow with the advection of the liquid phase.

## Results

From the video we observe that the droplet never touches the boundary. When the
the drop approaches the wall, we observe the formation of the vapor layer which
pushes the droplet away from the wall.
Depending on the physical properties used, the vapor layer thickness can
become very small, which requires a very fine grid in order to be able to resolve
this effect and to avoid the contact of the droplet with the wall.
If we use a more complex phase change model we need to ensure that the vaporization
rate is not too small, by setting a high value of wall and environment temperature.
