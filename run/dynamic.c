# Mesh dependent dynamic contact angle

Moving contact lines are often simulated by combining a static contact angle
model with no-slip boundary conditions on the solid surface. However, this
combination leads to a singularity in the viscous stresses at the contact line,
which is typically regularized by introducing a small slip length (although
other regularization mechanisms exist).

In VOF simulations, the interface is advected by the face velocity, located half
a grid cell away from the solid boundary. This introduces an implicit
(numerical) slip length that removes the contact line singularity. However, this
also results in mesh-dependent solutions.

In this file, we implement the models proposed by [Afkhami et al.
(2009)](#afkhami2009) and [Legendre and Maglio (2015)](#legendre2015). These
models exploit a [Cox–Voinov](https://youtu.be/K3gcJXDVjZU?si=K-dlcYATp7g-xa3l)-type
law to dynamically adjust the contact angle based on the local capillary number.

The two expressions for the dynamic contact angle considered here are:

$$
g(\theta_{d,1}) = g(\theta_s) + Ca_{cl} \log \left(\dfrac{L}{\lambda}\right)
\quad \text{with} \quad
g(\theta) = \int_0^\theta \dfrac{x - \sin{x}\cos{x}}{2\sin{x}} \, dx
$$

computed using the polynomial fit:
$$
  \text{g}(x) \approx x^3/9 + 0.00183985x^{4.5} + 1.845823\times 10^{-6} x^{12.258487}
$$
$$
  \text{g}^{-1}(x) \approx \sqrt[3]{9x} + 0.0727387 x - 0.0515388 x^2 + 0.00341336 x^3
$$

For $\theta_d < 3\pi/4$ this relation simplifies to ([Legendre and Maglio,
2015](#legendre2015)):

$$
\theta_{d,1}^3 = \theta_s^3 + 9 Ca_{cl} \log\left(\dfrac{L}{\lambda}\right)
$$

For density ratio equal to 1 and $|\cos(\theta)| < 0.6$ we can use the form
proposed by [Afkhami et al., 2009](#afkhami2009):

$$
\cos{\theta_{d,2}} = \cos{\theta_{s}} - 5.63 \, Ca_{cl} \log\left(\dfrac{L}{\lambda}\right)
$$

where the capillary number at the contact line is defined as
$Ca_{cl} = \mu u_{cl} / \sigma$.

The length scale at which the contact angle is resolved is $\Delta/2$, while
the length scale at which the apparent (equilibrium) contact angle belongs
depends on the model. Different configurations are summarized in the following
table (adapted from [Legendre and Maglio, 2015](#legendre2015)).

| Name  | Contact angle | Numerical scale $L$ | Equilibrium angle scale $\lambda$ | Slip length $\lambda_N$ |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|

## Sessile droplet

We can see that for each level of refinement, the droplet correctly relaxes towards a
steady configuration (the scheme is well-balanced). However, the spreading dynamics
changes depending on the resolution: as we increase the refinement we tend toward the
no-slip condition, which justifies the slower evolution of the higher refinements.

Introducing a Navier slip boundary condition with a slip length smaller than
half the grid size (i.e. under-resolved) is effectively equivalent to imposing a
no-slip condition in terms of contact line convergence. However, the presence of
slip still affects the dynamics, slowing down the interface evolution at all
refinement levels compared to the no-slip case.

We can achieve convergence on the interface position by using a slip length
which is larger than the grid size. In this case, it is equal to half the size
of the coarsest grid. However, if the viable grid refinements are much larger
than the physical slip length, this method is not adequate since it introduces
too much slip. For example, in the following plots the interface position does
converge, but at a much lower elevation compared to the no-slip case.

Introducing the dynamic angle models we can enforce the convergence of the
spreading dynamics. The model is really sensitive to the way the capillary
number and the contact line is computed, and to how the interface position is
reconstructed.

## Conclusions

Both the formulation by [Afkhami et al. (2009)](#afkhami2009) and the models by
[Legendre and Maglio (2015)](#legendre2015) converge, although the results are
different.

It is also important to note that a straightforward implementation of these
models does not guarantee correct behavior. In particular:

1. The interface position should be computed using height functions to ensure
   accurate contact line dynamics.
1. At high levels of refinement, small oscillations in the contact line velocity
   can induce large variations in the dynamic contact angle, potentially
   jeopardizing the simulation. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a
   relaxation factor that limits the variation of the contact angle between
   consecutive time steps.
1. The factor 9 in [Legendre and Maglio (2015)](#legendre2015) can not be
   omitted if we want to have the same behavior of the polynomial form. There must
   be a typo in the paper.
