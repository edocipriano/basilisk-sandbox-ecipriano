/**
# Pinning a 1mm Water Droplet

We want to extend the simulation in [pinning.c](pinning.c)
trying to pin a 1mm water droplet to a specific
point of the domain.

What we see is that, when a density and viscosity ratio is
imposed, the droplet is deformed in a strange manner.
Trying to figure out what's wrong I noticed the following
things:

1. If the boundary condition for *h* is not imposed
the problem persists;
2. If we comment the line `f.height = h`, the problem
disappears; of course in that case the droplet is not
pinned, but it does not show strange deformations. The
difference, in this case, is that [contact.h](/src/contact.h)
does not update height.

From the animation, it can be observed that the droplet
remains fixed at the pinning point but the interface is
aggressively deformed.
