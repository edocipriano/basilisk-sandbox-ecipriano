# Isothermal Evaporation of a Binary Droplet in Forced Convection

A binary liquid droplet, made of two components with the same
properties but with different volatilies evaporates in forced
convective conditions. The droplet is initially placed on the left
side of the domain. An inlet gas flowrate is imposed on the left
boundary, such that Re=160 with the initial diameter of the droplet.

The animation shows the evaporation of the liquid droplet, plotting
the mass fraction of the light component. The inlet velocity
transports the mass fraction toward the right boundary. The Reynolds
number selected for this simulation leads to the formation of
Von-Karman streets that can be visualized from the transport of the
chemical species mass fraction in gas phase.

/**
## Phase Change Setup

We let the default settings of the evaporation model: the
Stefan flow is shifted toward the liquid phase, and the
consistent phase is the liquid, which is advected using the
extended velocity. The multicomponent model requires the
number of gas and liquid species to be set as compiler
variables. We don't need to solve the temperature field
because the vapor pressure is set to a constant value,
different for each chemical species. */

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the centered solver with the evaporation source term
in the projection step. The extended velocity is obtained
from the doubled pressure-velocity coupling. We use the
evaporation model together with the multiomponent phase
change mechanism. */
