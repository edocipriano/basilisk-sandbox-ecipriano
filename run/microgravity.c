/**
# Microgravity Droplet Evaporation

Evaporation of a droplet in microgravity conditions with variable material
properties.  This test case is sufficiently general to simulate different
initial conditions by overwriting the compilation macros defined in
[defaultvars.h](defaultvars.h). In this case, we simulate the same test case in
[c7pathak.c](c7pathak.c) which consists in the evaporation of pure n-heptane in
a nitrogen environment. By using the same input data we can test the effect of
variable material properties on the droplet consumption dynamics.

<div class="message"> Note that [burningdroplet.c](burningdroplet.c) provides
the same functionality, but with improved generality and flexibility. It should
be preferred.</div>
*/

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the centered Navier--Stokes equations solver with volumetric source in
the projection step. The phase change is directly included using the evaporation
module, which sets the best (default) configuration for evaporation problems.
Many features of the phase change (evaporation) model can be modified directly
in this file without changing the source code, using the phase change model
object `pcm`. Compiling with `-DJUMP=1` changes the Navier--Stokes solver to the
velocity-jump formulation, which employs a GFM approach to set the interface
velocity jump. The density field is filtered in order to reduce convergence
issues related with strong density ratios. We include variable material properties
computed using OpenSMOKE++ or Cantera. */

We compare the constant and variable properties results. With variable

the different steady vaporization rate constant. Using OpenSMOKE++ the gap

properties. With Cantera we should introduce more functions for the liquid
properties.
