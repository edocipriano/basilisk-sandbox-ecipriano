# Epstein Plesset

This test case was borrowed from
[sandbox/farsoiya](/sandbox/farsoiya/phase_change/epstein-plesset.c)
and it was adapted to my phase change model. It describes
the consumption of a liquid droplet in an isothermal environment,
where the evaporation is driven by a gradient of chemical species.

This test case considers mass transfer in pure diffusive conditions.
Therefore, the Stefan flow is not considered in the theretical
solution, obtained assuming quasi-static conditions. In this context,
the chemical species concentration profile is assumed to be equal to
the steady-state concentration profile, at any simulation time instants.
This approximation is justified when the diffusion is much faster than
the interface regression velocity. Using this approximation, the
theretical solution describing the evolution of the droplet radius in
time was obtained by [Epstein and Plesset in 1950](#epstein1950stability):

$$
  \dfrac{dR}{dt} = -MW\dfrac{\mathcal{D} (\hat{c} - c_{bulk})}{\rho_g}
  \left(\dfrac{1}{R} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \mathcal{D} t}}\right)
$$

Even if [evaporation.h](../src/evaporation.h) is specifically
conceived for evaporation problems including the Stefan convection,
its formulation is general and it works also for diffusive
conditions. The initial setup of this simulation allows the expansion
term in the projection step to be null due to the density ratio equal
to 1, and the interface mass fraction is chosen to be sufficiently
small, so that the total vaporization rate tends to the pure
diffusive  conditions:

/**
## Simulation Setup

We use the centered solver with the divergence source term, and the
extended velocity can be obtained using the centered-doubled procedure.
Note that, for the conditions analyzed in this test case, the
extended velocity calculation can be skipped, in order to save
computational time, since *uf* and *ufext* will have exactly the same
value. The evaporation model is used in combination with the
species-gradient mechanism, which manages the calculation of the
vaporization rate for the pure droplet, and the solution of the
chemical species mass fraction field. */
