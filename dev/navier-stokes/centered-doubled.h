# Double Pressure-Velocity Coupling Model

This is a copy of the centered solver, adding the suffix *ext*
to the name of the quantities to be resolved. We want to find
a divergence-free velocity field for the advection of the volume
fraction field in phase change simulations.
Using this approach, we solve the pressure-velocity coupling twice,
first including the volume expansion term in the continuity equation
[navier-stokes/centered-evaporation.h](centered-evaporation.h), and
then with the classical incompressible continuity equation. This
method works well also for droplets in static conditions, with strong
density ratio or with high vaporization rate, since the field velocity
which contains the Stefan flow, and the velocity used for the advection
of the volume fraction field *ufext* are decoupled.

# Incompressible Navier--Stokes solver (centered formulation)

We wish to approximate numerically the incompressible,
variable-density Navier--Stokes equations
$$
\partial_t\mathbf{u}^E+\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}^E\otimes\mathbf{u}^E) = 
\frac{1}{\rho}\left[-\nabla p + \nabla\cdot(2\mu\mathbf{D})\right] + 
\mathbf{a}
$$
$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}^E = 0
$$
with the deformation tensor 
$\mathbf{D}=[\nabla\mathbf{u}^E + (\nabla\mathbf{u}^E)^T]/2$.

The scheme implemented here is close to that used in Gerris ([Popinet,
2003](/src/references.bib#popinet2003), [Popinet,
2009](/src/references.bib#popinet2009), [LagrÃ©e et al,
2011](/src/references.bib#lagree2011)).

We will use the generic time loop, a CFL-limited timestep, the
Bell-Collela-Glaz advection scheme and the implicit viscosity
solver. If embedded boundaries are used, a different scheme is used
for viscosity. */
